# Who's First

A simple, for-fun application created with Javascript, HTML, and CSS

## What's It Do

At home, we have the issue of my children (Reese, 9 and Harrison, 6) arguing about who has to take a bath first. So I created this little app to randomly choose either child to go first.

## How It Works

When the "Find Out" button is clicked, the app randomly chooses an integer between 1 and 10 inclusive. If the integer is less than or equal to 5, Harrison's name is displayed otherwise Reese's name is displayed. Simple animations and sounds also accompany each action.
